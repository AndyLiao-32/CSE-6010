# CSE 6010 - Computational Problem Solving
# Assignment 6 - Epidemic Network Model

## Instructions of the compiler and operating system 

 We use "sublime" as our text editor, and we compile the whole program of Epidemic Network Model via typing the command "make" on the Mac terminal, which will execute the makefile. In the makefile, we have already set up the compiler, gcc, and connected each source file, network.h and model.h, with the main program. Even though MacOS uses clang as the compiler, the command "gcc" will automatically transform to execute the clang.

 For the whole compiling and executing process, the following steps will lead you to successfully complete it.

 * Simply type "cd /Users/..../tliao32" to get to the file directory in your terminal

 * Type in "make" to compile the whole program.

 * Type in "./main" to execute the Epidemic Network Model program. 

 * The result will show on the screen.

 Therefore, by compiling on the operating system (MacOS), our compiler is "clang", version - 1000.10.44.4.
