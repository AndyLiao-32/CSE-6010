## Instructions of the compiler and operating system 

 I use "Visual Studio Code" as my text editor, and I compile my program in my terminal (gcc /Users..../powerlaw.c). After compiling, I can click on the powerlaw exec file and execute the program. Besides, I can simply type "cd /Users/..../tliao32" to get to the file directory and then type "./powerlaw" to execute the program. Therefore, by compiling on the operating system (MacOS), my compiler is "clang", version - 1000.10.44.4.
