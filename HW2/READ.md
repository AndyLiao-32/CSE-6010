## Instructions of the compiler and operating system 

 I use "Visual Studio Code" as my text editor, and I compile my program via typing the command "make" on my terminal, which will execute the makefile. In the makefile, I have already set up the compiler, gcc. Even though MacOS uses clang as the compiler, the command "gcc" will automatically transform to execute the clang. After compiling, I can click on the main exec file and execute the program. Besides, I can simply type "cd /Users/..../tliao32" to get to the file directory and then type "./main" to execute the program. Therefore, by compiling on the operating system (MacOS), my compiler is "clang", version - 1000.10.44.4.
